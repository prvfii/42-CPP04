    Understanding polymorphism through abstract classes and interfaces.

____________________________________________________________________________

Description

CPP Module 04 is the fifth project in the 42 C++ Piscine series. This module focuses on advanced polymorphism concepts, particularly abstract classes, pure virtual functions, and dynamic behavior. You will learn how to design systems using abstract interfaces, enabling flexible and scalable object-oriented solutions.

This project is essential for mastering the principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Topics Covered

	•	Abstract Classes:
	•	Defining interfaces with pure virtual functions.
	•	Preventing direct instantiation of abstract classes.
	•	Polymorphism:
	•	Using virtual functions to achieve runtime behavior.
	•	Handling derived classes via base class pointers.
	•	Dynamic Casting:
	•	Safely converting between base and derived class pointers.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Properly using destructors in polymorphic hierarchies.
